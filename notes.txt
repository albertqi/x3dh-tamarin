Meeting with Chong and Ana:
- Elliptic Curve Keys:
    - Tamarin does not support elliptic curve keys.
    - Substitute elliptic curve key with standard exponentiation.
    - Try introducing vulnerabilities and see if Tamarin can detect these.
    - Investigate the question: Can you express the elliptic key rules in Tamarin? What would you need in Tamarin to be able to model elliptic curve keys?
- KDF:
    - No need to model KDF.
    - One hash is fine.
